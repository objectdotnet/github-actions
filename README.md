[FTP deploy + Slack notification](https://github.com/objectdotnet/action-ftp-deploy-then-slack-notification) | A combined GitHub Action to FTP deploy on repository push, then send a Slack notification to a channel on `success` or `failure`. Both tasks are combined into one configurable Action to improve performance and reduce the time-to-complete.
